### Purpose of each file in our repository:
- exercise_collaborative_programming
- interim_deliverable

### Instructions on how to run our program from the command line on MacOS. If your program takes command-line arguments, please document the command-line interface (which arguments are required? which are optional, if any? what data types are you looking for? are there a specific format for data files? etc.)

### Instructions on how to use your program and/or interpret the output of the program. Anything the user might encounter while using your program that a random person on the street would not find self-explanatory needs to be explained in your instructions
